# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a newly discovered vulnerability or security issue is discovered, we kindly ask our users and security researchers to disclose it privately and securely via the [GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA)](https://github.com/spotflow-io/in-memory-azure-test-sdk/security/advisories/new) feature on this repository. Please do not report vulnerabilities via GitHub issues or other public channels. Disclosing a vulnerability publicly might lead to a situation where a vulnerability is widely known, but no fix is yet available, thus harming other users.

Alternatively, the report can be sent via email to `security@spotflow.io`. However, we prefer GHSA for security reasons.

Ultimately, we will publish all vulnerabilities publicly and credit the reporter appropriately for the discovery, but only after a fix is available.

## Bug Bounty Programs

Currently, we are not running any bug bounty programs.
